# Shopping list

A basic CRUD application implementing a shopping list.  
You can create, update and delete each item.  
I added some very basic validation to the update/create form, although it was not required.  
I've also noticed there was no mention of how the "Check item as done" functionality should look like, I added a checkbox for that as well.
