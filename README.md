# Shopping list

A basic CRUD application implementing a shopping list.  
You can create, update and delete each item.  
I added some things to this project that weren't mentioned in the figma:
- I added some very basic validation to the update/create form.  
- I've also noticed there was no mention of how the "Check item as done" functionality should be implemented, I added a checkbox for that as well.
- I didn't use Vuex because I didn't want to use any library that wasn't essential for this project.  
  Instead I created a service to work with as if I'm updating/fetching data from a server.
